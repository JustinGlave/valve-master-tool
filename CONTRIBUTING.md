# Contributing

This is an internal tool maintained by the ATS Inc. team. Contributions are limited to authorized team members.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the app directly for development:
   ```
   python valve_master_pyside6.py
   ```

## Making Changes

- Create a branch for your work: `git checkout -b your-feature-name`
- Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Test your changes manually before submitting, including edge cases
- For UI changes, verify at both normal and reduced window sizes
- Do not commit test data, credentials, or personal data files

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`
2. Describe what changed and why
3. Tag the repo owner for review

## Releases

Only the repo owner runs builds and publishes releases. See `build.bat` for the release process.
